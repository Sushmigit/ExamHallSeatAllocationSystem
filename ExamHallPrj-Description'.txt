Timetable Allocation

in timetable management , when allocate btn is clicked it should go to a page which asks for dept and sem then based on sem and dept it should show timetable details from timetable table with a btn allocate . when the btn is clicked , the below logic which i am going to tell should work, it should go through student table and cnt the no of students belong to this sem and dept and it should go through venue table and check if it is allocated or not if allocated it should check venue_allocation table and check whether the req no of seats are available by checking seats available col if available use that venue or check the next one in venue table and similarly check invigilator table if allocated go to next invigilator and find who is available after collecting all these details ,insert the student_id,timetable_id,available venue_id,invigilator name and seat no (write a logic to generate unique seat no which will be used when displaying seats visually ) to student_allocation table,insert timetable_id,venue_id,seats allocated for this timetable(cnt of students),invigilator name into timetable_allocation table,if newly allocated insert venue_id,invigilator,timetable_id,seats allocated,rem availble seats into venue allocation table if that venue is already allocated no need to use assign new invigilator (take care of that logic also) if we are using already allocated venue just update seats available and seats allocated cols in venue_allocation , insert invigilator_id,timetable-id,venue_id into invigilator table and also update allocated col in that 4 tables student , timetable , venue , invigilator 

Timetable Deallocation

now create 4 tables as student_deallocation,timetable_deallocation,venue_deallocation,invigilator_deallocation with same cols . when deallocate btn is clicked , go through student allocation table and check with timetable id and delete those rows from student_allocation table and insert it into student_deallocation table(to keep store past records) and also in the student table based on student id update allocated col as 0,then timetable allocation based on timetable id delete the row and insert it into timetable_deallocation and also update allocated col of timetable,based on venue_id check in venue_allocation table and decrease seats allocated and increase seats available based on cnt of students and after that check if seats allocated > 0 do not delete that row if it is equal to 0 delete it and insert it into venue_deallocation and similarly for invigilator (delete the invigilator only when venue has completelt removed)
